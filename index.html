                        <h3>Software</h3>
                        <p>Lightroom and Photoshop are both powerful software tools that are commonly used by us. <br>
                            Lightroom is a photo management and editing software that allows photographers to organize, edit, and share their photos all in one place. It offers a wide range of features for color correction, exposure adjustments, noise reduction, and more. Lightroom also can batch process photos, which can save photographers a significant amount of time when working with large numbers of images. <br>
                            Photoshop, on the other hand, is a more advanced image editing software that offers even greater control over image editing and manipulation. It is commonly used for tasks such as compositing, retouching, and creating graphic designs. Photoshop offers a wide range of tools and features, such as layers, masks, and brushes, that allow photographers to make precise adjustments to their images.
